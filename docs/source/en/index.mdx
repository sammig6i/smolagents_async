This library is the simplest framework out there to build powerful agents! By the way, wtf are "agents"? We provide our definition [in this page](conceptual_guides/intro_agents), where you'll also find tips for when to use them or not (spoilers: you'll often be better off without agents).

This library offers:

‚ú® **Simplicity**: the logic for agents fits in ~thousand lines of code. We kept abstractions to their minimal shape above raw code!

üåê **Support for any LLM**: it supports models hosted on the Hub loaded in their `transformers` version or through [Inference providers](https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-providers/index): Cerebras, Cohere, Fal, Fireworks, Hyperbolic, Nebius, Novita, Replicate, SambaNova, Together, etc. It also supports models from OpenAI, Anthropic... it's really easy to power an agent with any LLM.

üßë‚Äçüíª **First-class support for Code Agents**, i.e. agents that write their actions in code (as opposed to "agents being used to write code"), [read more here](tutorials/secure_code_execution).

ü§ó **Hub integrations**: you can share and load Gradio Spaces as tools to/from the Hub, and more is to come!
